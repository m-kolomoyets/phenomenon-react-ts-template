## üß∂ Structure

### API requests

API requests are created globally in the root of the project to be used inside API hooks. API request are not directly called in project, only in hooks.

API requests should be located inside `src/services/api` folder.

API requests are performed with some library like `ky`, `axios` etc. Based on the library, `src/services/api` folder should contain the appropriate file `ky.ts` or `axios.ts`. This file should contain all instances for all origins.

Example:
```ts
// ky.ts

export const http = ky.create(...);
export const formsHttp = http.extend(...);
```

API requests should:
- be separated to files based on request origin `<originName>Http` -> `<originName>.ts`
  - Example: `formsHttp` -> `forms.ts`
- contain the requests to only the origin it is named for:
  ```ts
  // src/services/api/forms.ts

  // ‚úÖ Allowed:
  import { formsHttp } from './ky';


  // ‚ùå Not allowed:
  import { formsHttp, dashboardHttp } from './ky'
  ```

#### API queryClient options

When Tanstack Query is used, queryClient entity is created once on project start, and is used within all the application. By setting it in global api folder, we will be able to use it wherever needed in the app.

The query client configuration file should be located at `src/services/tanstack-query/queryClient.ts` and include configuration as follows as bare minimum:
```ts
import { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
        queries: {
            refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
            retry: 1,
        },
        mutations: {
            retry: 1,
        },
    },
});
```

This configuration should be passed to `<QueryClientProvider />` in `src/main.tsx` file.

>NOTE: This configuration as allowed to be used wherever using `useQueryClient` hook is not allowed:
>- routes loaders
>- functions may include api logic (setting query data etc.)


### Icons

Icons should be located at `src/icons` folder.

Every icon should:
- Have lowercase name with kebab case formatting (example: `profile.svg` or `airplane-landing.svg`)

Prerequisites:
- Compress exported SVG with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) tool

### Contexts

Contexts are optional for the root of the project and components among all the project.

No matter, where the contexts will appear, they should:
- Have separate `contexts` folder inside the folder where the hooks will be used
  - Global contexts will be used in all the project, should be located at `src/contexts` folder. NOTE: Any component is allowed to call such contexts.
  - If context will be used inside single component exclusively, you should create `contexts` folder inside the component folder. Example: `src/components/ArticleCard/contexts`. NOTE: such contexts are not allowed to be used outside of the component scope where the hooks folder were created. If such case appears, then you should move the hook(s) into global hooks folder. The child components (`src/components/ArticleCard/components/*`) only are allowed to use the context inside

Each context should:
- Be created inside the `contexts` folder
- Have pascal case name, ending with `<contextName>Context` (example: `AuthContext.tsx`)
- NOTE: The context file name should match the context name inside the file

``` ts
// src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx

const AuthContext = createContext(...);
```

### Stores

Stores are optional for the root of the project. Current rules are applied for `zustand` stores

Stores are allowed to use in all the project.

Stores should:
- Have separate root `src/stores` folder

Each store should:
- Have camel case name, ending with `<storeName>Store` (example: `authStore.tsx`)
- NOTE: The store file name should match the store hook name name inside the file
  - `<storeName>Store.ts` -> `use<StoreName>Store.ts`

``` ts
// src/stores/authStore.ts

export const useAuthStore = create(...)
```

### Hooks

Hooks are optional for the root of the project and components among all the project.

No matter, where the hooks will appear, they should:
- Have separate `hooks` folder inside the folder where the hooks will be used
  - Global hooks will be used in all the project, should be located at `src/hooks` folder
  - If hook will be used inside single component exclusively, you should create `hooks` folder inside the component folder. Example: `src/components/ArticleCard/hooks`. NOTE: such hooks are not allowed to be used outside of the component scope where the hooks folder were created. If such case appears, then you should move the hook(s) into global hooks folder

Each hook should:
- Be created inside the `hooks` folder
- Have camel case name, starting with `use` (example: `useHavePermissions.ts`)
- NOTE: The hook file name should match the hook name inside the file

``` ts
// src/hooks/useHavePermissions.ts

export const useHavePermissions = () => {...}
```

#### Services

Services are optional for the root of the project and components among all the project.
Services should contain all API requests and hooks.
Services may include other scopes like authentication services, permissions etc.

Services are allowed to use in all the project.

Services should:
- Have separate root `src/services` folder
- Each service scope should have its own folder
- Each service scope should have its own file

##### API Services

API services are services that contain API requests functions to be used in API hooks.

API services should:
- Be located at `src/services/api` folder
- Have camel case name, ending with `<serviceName>` (example: `forms.ts`)
- Names of the service also should be matched to file name in API hooks service folder

##### API hooks

Because of using Tanstack query, and its hooks mechanic, following the TkDodo's recommendations, all API requests should be inside custom hooks that call `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks. API requests were described in the relevant section above.

API hooks should be located inside `src/services/tanstack-query` folder.

API hooks should:
- be named for the api file. `<api>.ts` -> `<api>.ts`
  - Example: `src/services/api/forms.ts` -> `src/services/tanstack-query/forms.ts`
- contain all hooks for every function declared in the api requests file

Single API hook should:
- be named for the api request function. `<requestName>` -> `use<RequestName>`
  - Example: `submitForm` -> `useSubmitForm`

###### Query keys

Query keys should be managed in the `src/services/tanstack-query/queryKeys.ts` file.

This file should contain objects with fields contain queryKeys.
Each field of this object should return constant array with query keys.

Naming convention:
- Each query keys scope should contain the `all` field with the base query key
- For lists, you should create the `list` function that returns the query key for the list
  - If lists have filters and other parameters, you should create the `listWith<ParametersName>` function that returns the query key for the list with the parameter
- For single items, you should create the `item` function that returns the query key for the item

Example:
```ts
export const BOOKS_API_KEYS = {
    all: ['books'] as const,
    list() {
        return [...BOOKS_API_KEYS.all, 'list'] as const
    },
    listWithSearch(search: string) {
        return [...BOOKS_API_KEYS.list(), 'with-search' search] as const
    },
    item(id: string) {
        return [...BOOKS_API_KEYS.all, 'item', id] as const
    },
}
```

>NOTE: Query keys contacts are allowed to be used in all the project to make invalidations and prefetched possible on a lot of events occur by user activities.

And apply this in:
- Query hooks:
  ```ts
  export const useGetBooks = (search: string) => {
    return useQuery({
        ...BOOKS_API_KEYS.listWithSearch(search)
        // ...
    })
  }
  ```
- Query options:
  ```ts
  export const getBooksQueryOptions = (search: string) => {
    return queryOption({
        ...BOOKS_API_KEYS.listWithSearch(search)
        // ...
    });
  }

  export const useGetBooks = (search: string) => {
    return getBooksQueryOptions(search);
  }
  ```
- Query invalidations:
  ```ts
  import { BOOKS_API_KEYS } from '@/services/tanstack-query/queryKeys';

  queryClient.invalidateQueries({
    queryKey: BOOKS_API_KEYS.all
  })
  ```
- Query prefetches:
  ```ts
  import { BOOKS_API_KEYS } from '@/services/tanstack-query/queryKeys';

  queryClient.prefetchQuery({
     queryKey: BOOKS_API_KEYS.all
  })

  // or

  queryClient.getQueryData({
     queryKey: BOOKS_API_KEYS.all
  })
  ```

##### Query hooks

Query hooks can have the parameters to be passed like pagination, search params etc. These parameters should be passed into hooks as arguments. Recommended to pass the arguments as list of arguments, not as the object.

Example:
```ts
export const useGetBooks = (search: string) => {
    return useQuery({
        queryKey: BOOKS_API_KEYS.listWithSearch(search)
        // ...
    })
}

export const useGetBooksByAuthorName = (authorName: string, search: string) => {
    return useQuery({
        queryKey: BOOKS_API_KEYS.listWithSearch(authorName, search)
        // ...
    })
}
```

#### Mutation hooks

Mutation hooks from `useMutation` return the callable function as result, so no need to pass the arguments into hook call. But everything can happen to pass initial arguments into hook body directly for query client logic or whatever.

```ts
// src/services/api/books.ts

export const addBookToFavorites = (bookId: string) => {...}

// src/services/tanstack-query/books.ts

import { addBookToFavorites } from '@/services/api/books';

export const useAddBookToFavorites = () => {
    return useMutation({
        mutationFn: addBookToFavorites
        // ...
    })
}

// somewhere
import { useAddBookToFavorites } from '@/services/tanstack-query/books';

// ...

const { mutate: addBookToFavorites } = useAddBookToFavorites();

// ...

addBookToFavorites(bookId, {...})

```

### Utility functions

Utility functions are optional for the root of the project and components among all the project.

No matter, where the utils will appear, they should:
- Have separate `utils` folder inside the folder where the utils will be used
  - Global utils will be used in all the project, should be located at `src/utils` folder
  - If util will be used inside single component exclusively, you should create `utils` folder inside the component folder. Example: `src/components/ArticleCard/utils`. NOTE: such utils are not allowed to be used outside of the component scope where the utils folder were created. If such case appears, then you should move the util(s) into global utils folder

Each util should:
- Be created inside the `utils` folder
- Have camel case name (example: `getHasPermissions.ts`)
- NOTE: The util file name should match the util name inside the file
- (Optional): Unit tests can be written for the util
  - `<utilName>.ts` -> `<utilName>.test.ts`

``` ts
//getHasPermissions.ts

export const getHasPermissions = () => {...}
```

>NOTE: There is also the another type of utils - sort of primitive which are 100% sure they return predictable result and no need in tests, so these utils should be located at `.../utils/common.ts`

### Constants

Constants are optional for the root of the project and components among all the project.

There are 2 types of constants to use:
- Regular constants (`constants.ts`)
- Schemas constants (`schemas.ts`)

The rules described below are applied for both of them.
The only difference is:
- `constants.ts` - for regular constants like time tokens, regexps etc.
- `schemas.ts` - for `zod` schemas will be used in other schemas in all the project

No matter, where the constants will appear, they should:
- Have separate `constants.ts` file inside the folder where the constants will be created
  - Global constants will be used in all the project, should be located at `src/constants.ts` file
  - If constants will be used inside single component exclusively, you should create `constants.ts` file inside the component folder. Example: `src/components/ArticleCard/constants.ts`.
   >NOTE: such constants are not allowed to be used outside of the component scope where the constants file were created. If such case appears, then you should move the constants(s) into global constants file

#### Schemas

One more thing should be applied to schemas:
- Each schema should have camel case name with ending `<schemaName>Schema`.
```ts
export const signUpSchema = ...
```

### Types

Types are optional for the root of the project and components among all the project.

The root project types should include:
- Generic global types
- Global primitive types for several components

The components types should include:
- Component props
- Components props partitions

### Styles

Styles are optional for the root of the project and components among all the project.

The global styles are located inside `src/styles` folder
This folder should include:
- `index.css` - root project styles (incl. imports of other root style files described below)
- `reset.css` - predefined browsers styles reset file
- `variables.css` - (optional) global variables file. This file can be created if there are a lot of variables to create and manage them easily. In case of ~25 variables they can still be maintained in `index.css`.
- `fonts.css` - (optional) global fonts to be implemented through `@font-face` directive.

### Components
Components should be located at:
- `src/ui`
  - basic primitive components (Example: buttons, typography, wrappers etc.)
  - do not have complex logic (complex hooks, contexts)
  - can NOT use `src/components` components inside
- `src/components`
  - complex components use `src/ui` components inside as building blocks
  - Can have any types of hooks, contexts inside


#### Anatomy

The component should:
- Have separate folder
- Have pascal case name (example: `Button` or `ArticleCard`)
- Have default export of the component itself

The component folder should contain:
- `<ComponentName>.tsx` - the component JSX
- `<ComponentName>.module.css` - the styles of component file (optional)
- `index.ts` the entry point file for exporting required modules from component

```ts
export * from './<ComponentName>';
export { default } from './<ComponentName>';
// ... if needed, may export types and/or constants
```

> NOTE: If component ha to haves hooks/utils/constants/contexts, take a look at relevant chapters above.

### Modules

Modules are core blocks are used for routing. Router entries render modules only. It is not allowed to pass the components from `src/components` or `src/ui`.

Modules are located at `src/modules` folder.

Modules represent pages we should display within router. Modules hierarchy may also represent the routes subrouting.

Every module should:
- be named for the route it represent:
  - `http://localhost:3000/about` -> `src/modules/About`
- have the same architecture as `src/components` or `src/ui` as described above
- have no props
- module name should match the module component name:
  ```ts
  // src/modules/About/About.tsx

  export const About: React.FC = () => {...}
  ```

Modules are allowed:
- to use `src/components` and/or `src/ui` components inside
- to have owb hooks
- to have own constants/schemas/styles
- to have own sub-components (`src/modules/About/components/...`)
- to use its sub-modules inside if it is not a sub-route

#### Submodules

Submodules are the modules inside the some module (`src/modules/About/components/...`).

Submodules may have everything regular modules can have and do, but they can be used in two ways:
- as sub-component for the rot module
  - but it is already not allowed to be used as sub-route
- as sub-route:
  - `src/modules/About/components/Settings` -> `http://localhost:3000/about/settings`

### Routing

Tanstack Router is used as main router utility with file-based routing functionality.

Routes are located at `src/routes` folder.

#### `__root.tsx` file

Thi file is used to set up the initial router with global component and parameters.

Root file may include:
- Devtools
- Global context providers
- 404 page set up

#### File-based routing

All files and folders inside `src/routes` folder are represented as client routes by the file name:
```
src/routes/index.tsx -> http://localhost:3000/
src/routes/about.tsx -> http://localhost:3000/about/
src/routes/about/settings.tsx -> http://localhost:3000/about/settings
```

Folders cam include the subroutes and index route:
```
src/routes/about/index.tsx -> http://localhost:3000/about/
src/routes/about/settings.tsx -> http://localhost:3000/about/settings
```

Routes can be lazy-loaded or not.

Lazy-loaded routes can:
- render the module dynamically when the route is called
- include pending components
- include error component
- include 404 component

Regular route can:
- everything lazy-loaded routes can
- validate search parameters
- perform prefetches with loader
- perform actions before loader executes

>NOTE: regular routes have more memory load, so if no need in search parameters load or prefetch, plea use lazy routes.

Route have different file naming convection inside `src/routes` folder:

Routes should:
- be named with kebab-case lowercase (`src/routes/<route-name>.tsx`)
- If lazy - add `.lazy` before `.tsx` (`src/routes/<route-name>.lazy.tsx`)
- have no props
- have route module name matched to route name but pascal-case ending with `<ModuleName>Page`:
  ```ts
  // src/routes/about.tsx

  import About from '@/modules/about';

  const AboutPage = createLazyFileRoute('/about')({
    component: About
  })
  ```

#### Mixing route types

There is possibility to have route mixing between lazy and regular.

We are able to split the logic this way:
- Regular route
  - validate search parameters
  - perform prefetches with loader
  - perform actions before loader executes
- Lazy route
  - render the module dynamically when the route is called

In terms of code it looks this way:

Folder structure:
```
src/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ about/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.lazy.tsx
```

```ts
// index.lazy.tsx

import About from '@/modules/about';

const AboutPage = createLazyFileRoute('/about')({
    component: About
})

// index.tsx
import { noopReturnNull } from '@/utils/common';

const AboutPage = createFileRoute('/about')({
    component: noopReturnNull,
    validateSearch(search) {...},
    beforeLoad() {...}
    loader({ search }) {...},
})
```

#### Layouts

Tanstack router allows to create layouts.

Layouts should:
- be named for layout semanticsm kebab-cae, starting with `_` and ending with `-layout`:
  - Example: `src/routes/_protected-layout/`
- have both folder and file (not lazy) named by this layout:
  ```
  src/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _protected-layout/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.lazy.tsx
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _protected-layout.tsx
  ```

Layout component should be stored at `src/components/layouts` folder.

Layout components should:
- have same structure as `src/components` have
- include `<Outlet />` a child of component
- have no props

```ts
// src/components/layouts/ProtectedLayout/ProtectedLayout.tsx
import { Outlet } from '@tanstack/react-router';

const ProtectedLayout: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            // ...
            <Outlet />
        </div>
    )
}

// src/routes/_protected-layout.tsx

import ProtectedLayout from '@/components/layouts/ProtectedLayout';

const ProtectedLayoutPage = createFileRoute('/_protected-layout')({
    component: ProtectedLayout
    // ...
})
```

#### Route API hooks

Routes have own hooks like `useSearch` and `useNavigate` or other that `getRouteApi` return ([docs](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/getRouteApiFunction)). For optimizing the router tree iterations and by following the maintainer recommendations we should have the `from` attribute predefined for each route we have the hooks calls at.

it is recommended to create custom route hooks for each module as follows:

```ts
// src/modules/About/hooks/ueAboutRouteApi.ts

import { getRouteApi } from '@tanstack/react-router';

const aboutRouteApi = getRouteApi('/about');

export const ueAboutRouteApi = () => {
    const search = aboutRouteApi.useSearch();
    const navigate =  aboutRouteApi.useNavigate();

    return { search, navigate };
}

// src/modules/About/About.tsx

const About: React.FC = () => {
    const { search, navigate } = ueAboutRouteApi();

    // ...
}
```

If no search needed, you may just return the navigate. Route API logic allows us to get the route data directly by setting the entry point as route id, which is autocompleted in dev mode launched.

This methodology can be applied to layouts a well.

<summary> ‚ú≥Ô∏è Icons Usage</summary>

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Icons Usage

1. Collect all icons as separate files with `.svg` extension and kebab-case naming.

Example:
```md
src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icons
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arrow-left.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ search.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ arrow-right-circle.svg
```

2. Import icon required as follows:
```ts
import { Component as ArrowLeftIcon } from '@/icons/arrow-left.svg?svgUse';
```

3. Use the icon as regular JSX component:
```ts
<ArrowLeftIcon className={s.icon} />
```

Type of the component and its props:
Location: `Location: node_modules/@svg-use/react/dist/esm/ThemesExternalSvg.d.ts`

```ts
declare const createThemedExternalSvg: ({ url, id, viewBox }: FactoryProps) => (props: ThemeProps & SVGAttributes<SVGSVGElement>) => JSX.Element;

export interface ThemeProps {
	color?: string;
	colorSecondary?: string;
	colorTertiary?: string;
}
```

Key moments:

- üëâ Import Component names export, then name it as applicable icon naming is.
- üëâ Autocomplete will support path to the svg file, ‚ö†Ô∏èBUT‚ö†Ô∏è you should add ?svgUse param at the end of import statement for @svg-use to work
